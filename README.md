Predicting the Satisfaction of the Customers

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick 
around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would
allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

I worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied
with their banking experience.
